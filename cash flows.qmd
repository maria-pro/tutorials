## Can we not talk about.. (no, not quarto..) cash flows!

We are continuing with a series of blog posts around actuarial-accounting domain where we strive to lighten up interest of the data science community in using their R skills for the actuarial/accounitng domain. We also hope to help some actuaries and accountants with their R skills.

This time we cannot avoid the elephant in the cupboard - which is cash flows in times of recession.

So ~~how is your cash going?~~ working through and communicating the cash flow analysis. Cash flows is one of the main business concepts and ~~disclosure~~ proper communication of your cash flows breakdown is vital for any business ~~and household!~~.

While presentation of cash flows is vital at any times, the recession (can we finally say it?) make it really important to show it not only truly and fairly (in accounting terminology), but also to communicate it to the highest impact.

So what is the problem with its communication? Well. Look at the image below and tell how excited you are and does it make a lot of sense if you give a flash look:

It is incredibly insightful (if you do know what to look for), but for an non-accounting person (with powers to make decisions), it may not be.

Now look at this!

This is another cash flow from a fellow Excel tutorial. It is a personal cash flow to be exact, but oh so insightful! Those numbers start talking to me - showing in a sec where all my money goes!

We all know that a picture is worth a thousand words, but if it is a thousand millions \$, it's truly priceless.

So. let's beg for automation and turn to data God's for wisdom ~~yes, open your RStudio everyone!~~

This type of charts is called **sankey charts**, they are NOT common at all in the actuarial/accounting world, but, honestly, it is not that common to see lots of visualisations in the financial reports, well, apart from happy customers in annual reports which, as we all know, is a marketing thing.

Sankey charts are used to show **flows** and **cash flows** is a good example of such usage.

Let's have a look at the example above when the cash flows are shown in Excel and Google Sheets and develop a visualization in R.

There are several ways to do this and several packages available.

To name a view - `networkD3` package, `diagrammeR` package

The dataset is an extremely simple one - to demonstrate the application, while we can further extend it to include more transactional data, different sources of income, types of income, etc. On the next step we can look at inflows and outflows, classify them into types of business activities by automating this usually tedious and manual task and present in a nice chart to our stakeholders.

But. let's start with ... this simple one! And let's use the [`networkD3`](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/networkD3)

```{r}
library(tidyverse)
library(networkD3)
```

You can view some awesome visualizations with this package [here](https://r-graph-gallery.com/sankey-diagram.html)

```{r}
data<-read_csv("data/cf_up.csv")
```

This type of diagram is based on visualising **flows** which are connections from one **node** to another. In our case the flows are distinct types of cash income that flows into the entity.

The input can be done as a connection data with 3 columns that show:

as well as incidence matrix, which is a square matrix mapping those nodes and connections between them.

This example demonstrates some basic workings when a dataframe of nodes is used 

The dataset shows the sources of income `income_source`, type of income `type_income`, type of cash flow  which is cash receipts, `income`. It also shows the use of the money - cash payments, `spending_source`, and type of spending, `spending_type`. 

**Note**: 

In this particular example, we use the dataset from the tutorial for Excel users. Some data transformations have already done there to suit "Excel-type" steps. For example, the amount of cash receipts were matched with a particular cash spending type. In real life, you would not expect this data matching as most likely your cash flow records just shows type of cash flow (cash receipt vs cash payment) and the amount. The matching to the type of cash receipt/cash payment is still required as to match this individual items with the *type of income* or *type of expense* 

To create a cash flow we need two dataframes that we will use in `sankeyNetwork()` function from the ` networkD3` package:

- *dataframe 1* is a nodes dataframe with list of receipts, types of receipts, types of spending and cash payments

- *dataframe 2* is a links dataframe which itemized each flow using a source, target and value column. For example, we received 494US part of the salary was used to pay tax: salary is the earned income and payment of tax is a deduction. In this case the source is the `Salary` item, the target is `Earned income`  and the value is 494. `Earned income`is also a source node that has `Income` (i.e. a broader category) target. `Income` is then distributed to expenses, i.e target category `Deduction` which is the later becomes a source node for `Income tax` target.

We start with setting up a list of nodes: in this case we have *sources* (the nodes that initiate the flow) and *targets* (the nodes that finish the flow). At this stage let's create just a list of all nodes which are all cash flow elements

The *sources* are `income_source`, `income_type`, `income` and `spending_source`. Our *targets* are `income_type`, `income`, `spending_source` and `spending_type`

As the original dataset is not a common way to represent cash flow items (i.e. receipts and payments), we transformed the original dataset to focus on building the chart and work with the updated dataset.

```{r}
nodes <- data.frame(
  name=c(as.character(data$source), 
  as.character(data$target)) %>% unique()
)
```

We cannot use nodes names in the function and need to replace our connections with id, i.e. `IDsource` and `IDtarget`

```{r}

data$IDsource <- match(data$source, nodes$name)-1 
data$IDtarget <- match(data$target, nodes$name)-1
```


```{r}
p <- sankeyNetwork(Links = data, 
                   Nodes = nodes,
                   Source = "IDsource", 
                   Target = "IDtarget",
                   Value = "value", 
                   NodeID = "name",
                   units = '$',
                   sinksRight=TRUE,
  #                 LinkGroup="source"
                   fontSize = 10, 
                   nodeWidth = 30
                   
                   )
p
```

Now, let's highlight different types of receipts and payments

```{r}



# Add a 'group' column to the nodes data frame:
data<-data%>%
  mutate(group=case_when(
      grepl("Income", target) ~ "income",
      grepl("Expense", target) ~ "expense",
      TRUE ~ "others")
      )
  
  
p <- sankeyNetwork(Links = data, 
                   Nodes = nodes,
                   Source = "IDsource", 
                   Target = "IDtarget",
                   Value = "value", 
                   NodeID = "name",
                   units = '$',
                   sinksRight=TRUE,
#                   LinkGroup="source"

#,
#                   NodeGroup="group"
                   #fontSize = 10, nodeWidth = 30
                   
                   )
p
# Give a color for each group:
my_color <- 'd3.scaleOrdinal() .domain(["a", "b"]) .range(["#69b3a2", "steelblue"])'
```




```
